The following explains how to get widht, height and point coordinates of an svg file and write them to a txt file.
First open a txt file that will contain svg dimension and points, then follow the steps:

1. If svg file has width and height properties(e.g. width=100 etc.), these should be the width and height for input points text file.
    First line of input text file will be height|width
2. If svg file does not have width and height properties, then  we need to find box dimension 
    using javascript code. Open the svg file with a text editor and do the following:
        a. find <path .../> in svg file and change, or add id(if does not exist) like:   <path id="myPath" .../>
        b. add following js code at the end of svg file before svg end tag </svg>
        c. open the svg file with a browser. The alert will show the height and width. Use these height and width
            as the height|width of input text file 
3. go to https://shinao.github.io/PathToPoints/ link, drag and drop svg file, copy the generated point coordinates
    and append them to the input point text file from the second line.

js code snippet to add to svg:
<script>
var myPathBox = document.getElementById("myPath").getBBox();

alert("height: " + myPathBox.height + "width: " + myPathBox.width);
console.log(myPathBox)
</script>


N.B. : The width and height found from the path can be different from the fixed properties width and height at the
begining of the svg file. The reason is, the properties width and height are fixed and the image stays anywhere 
inside the box. If w and h calculaed from path, that means the image covers entire widht and height that was 
calculaed from the path.
